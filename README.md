How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs, asking additional questions on design, software layout, features, etc., allows me to understand better the requirements they look forward to seeing. These needs are essential and can then be implemented with the specific input and outputs for the software to function as intended. Creating "user stories" help with this process by having a detailed document of what users want, how these features should be portrayed, and how they can do these tasks themselves clearly and easily.  

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, it can be approached by different methodologies, such as the agile and waterfall approach. In this case, I plan to include agile methodology in future development works as it includes having the ability to change anything quickly and efficiently to maintain the program's integrity and quality. These are essential aspects to incorporate as a client can change their mind about what to include or remove from the program at any time; this random occurrence makes the agile processes important to know.
